You'll get a free trial with 5 dollars of credit when you set up your account, which may not seem like much but $5 can grant us a LOT of API calls. If you're worried about being charged for anything, make sure you set up a usage limit on your account! We're going to be using a LLM (pre-trained by OpenAI) inside a LangChain application. \n",
